## Selected Presentations and Workshops

### Fail4Lib Workshop (2013-present)

Fail4Lib is a perennial [Code4Lib](https://code4lib.org/) workshop offering dedicated to discussing and coming to terms with the failures that we all encounter in our professional lives. It is a safe space for us to explore failure, to talk about our own experiences with failure, and to encourage enlightened risk taking. The goal of Fail4Lib is for participants – and their organizations – to get better at failing gracefully, so that when we do fail, we do so in a way that moves us forward.

Fail4Lib was created and originally co-facilitated by Jason Casden and myself, with Bret Davidson co-facilitating for several years. I have been facilitating the program on my own since 2017.

### The City and the City: Insider and Outsider Experiences in Systems and UX (2020)

Presentation at [UX Y'all 2020](https://www.uxyall.org/). How do we know whether a problem can be solved by design? In this presentation I discuss the relationship between systems and UX, and look at the role that the boundaries we define play in the success or failure of our systems.

### What a Baby Taught Me about Affordances (2019)

Lightning talk at [Code4Lib 2019](https://2019.code4lib.org/). When my oldest kid was a few months old, he gave me insight into how affordances work -- and how they fail.

### Shear Forces: a Conceptual Model for Understanding (and Coping With) Risk, Change, and Technical Debt (2019)

Presentation at [Code4Lib 2019](https://2019.code4lib.org/). Our work processes naturally evolve, improve, and adapt to changing environments. Because of this, we often find ourselves in situations where the supporting components of the system struggle to keep up. To borrow a concept from fluid dynamics, the result is a “shear force” where layers at different velocities interact. Too much shear leads to turbulence, which can actively disrupt the useful work of the system. In this presentation I explore how shear as a conceptual model can help us plan for changes not yet upon us, and consider how to ensure that our systems remain performant even in times of change.

### Systems Thinking: a Practical Field Guide (2018)

Presentation at [Code4Lib 2018](https://2018.code4lib.org/); reprised at [UX Y'all 2019](https://www.uxyall.org/). An introduction to reading and analyzing systems in the wild, with an emphasis on unpacking a system's key features starting with scant information.

### It's Made of People: Designing Systems for Humans (2017)

Invited keynote presentation at [Code4Lib 2017](https://2017.code4lib.org/). Reprised as an invited keynote at the 2019 NC Serials Conference and an invted talk at the 2019 East Carolina University Joyner Library Staff Development Day. We rely on systems in our day-to-day work, but systems are at best flawed representations of our own work and our customers' goals. How do we ensure that our system is effective and friendly to the human actors in light of their inherent limitations?

### Architecture is Politics: the Power and the Perils of Systems Design (2016)

Presentation at [Code4Lib 2016](https://2016.code4lib.org/). As the designers and implementers of complex systems (such as websites, discovery tools, and knowledge repositories), we have great -- if sometimes unrealized -- power. And, as Stan Lee says, with great power comes great responsibility.
