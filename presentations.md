## Selected Presentations

### The City and the City: insider and outsider experiences in systems and UX (2020)

Presentation at UX Y'all 2020. How do we know whether a problem can be solved by design? In this presentation I discuss the relationship between systems and UX, and look at the role that the boundaries we define play in the success or failure of our systems.

### What a baby taught me about affordances (2019)

Lightning talk at Code4Lib 2019. When my baby was about six months old, he gave me insight into how affordances work -- and how they fail.

### Systems thinking: a practical field guide (2018)

### It's made of people: designing systems for humans (2017)

Invited keynote presentation at the Code4Lib 2017 conference. Reprised as an invited keynote at the 2019 NC Serials Conference and an invted talk at the 2019 East Carolina University Joyner Library Staff Development Day. We rely on systems in our day-to-day work, but systems are at best flawed representations of our own work and our customers' goals. How do we ensure that our system is effective and friendly to the human actors in light of their inherent limitations?

### Architecture is politics: the power and the perils of systems design (2016)

Presentation at the Code4Lib 2016 conference. As the designers and implementers of complex systems (such as websites, discovery tools, and knowledge repositories), we have great -- if sometimes unrealized -- power. And, as Stan Lee says, with great power comes great responsibility.
