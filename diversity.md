## Universal, ethical, compassionate design

Central to effective development and stewardship of products and services is recognizing the diversity of the user base. Each participant in the systems I develop has their own needs, perspectives, and lived experiences that I am not and cannot be fully aware of. In recognition of this, I consult a range of end users, colleagues, and experts, considering and acting on their feedback so that the products I develop might address each userâ€™s needs as effectively as possible. 

I approach producct and service development with an awareness of the limits of my own perspective, and I work to better myself and my teams: by reflecting meaningfully on diversity, equity, and inclusion; by actively confronting my own assumptions; and by challenging myself to see the world from other vantage points. My work in this direction includes ongoing study of systems analysis, with a focus on ethics, bias, and universal design in systems; participation in formal training such as the [Racial Equity Institute program](https://www.racialequityinstitute.com/) and accessible design workshops; and effective project management that includes seeking diverse representation in project development and championing universal and compassionate design as a team leader.
