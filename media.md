## Selected Graphical and Video Projects

### Mid-South Fencers' Club Longsword Program logo (2017)

Dre is the lead instructor (and, as it turns out, lead designer) for Mid-South Fencers' Club's longsword program. His goal in this project was to create a design appropriate for multiple applications (program logo, t-shirt design, club banner) to represent the program, highlighting the club's Durham heritage and integrating the idea of the longsword into the logo.

### *Anatomy of a Scholarly Article* interactive tutorial (2009)

An interactive tutorial highlighting the parts of a scholarly article, and the purpose and significance of each part. Although the definition of "peer reviewed article" is quite subtle, a college freshman will typically identify one taxonomically. This tutorial is meant to facilitate that sort of identification. Dre designed, developed, and implemented this tutorial from the ground up.
