I'm Andreas "Dre" Orphanides, Associate Head, User Experience at the [NC State University Libraries](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu). My work focuses on discovery systems, wayfinding, and interaction design. Areas of professional interest include systems analysis, human factors, and design ethics.

## Just curious? Start with these three (or four) things.

Here's a sampling of my work. Start here to get a sense of who I am and what I do in UX and systems.

### User research project: Aligning Discovery and the User Journey (2019-present)

How can libraries present an experience to users that better conforms with their mental model of information seeking? This project endeavors to understand how users frame the problem of information discovery in an educational context, so that library services can be framed to better match users' mental models. My contributions include project coordination, research design, conducting user research, leading analysis via affinity mapping, and participating in design and development of new website features based on study findings.

### Short talk (5 minutes): What a Baby Taught Me about Affordances (2019)

Presented at [Code4Lib 2019](https://2019.code4lib.org/). When my oldest kid was a few months old, he gave me insight into how affordances work -- and how they fail.

Or, if you've got time for a full presentation...

### Full talk (40 minutes): The City and the City: Insider and Outsider Experiences in Systems and UX (2020)

Presented at [UX Y'all 2020](https://www.uxyall.org/). How do we know whether a problem can be solved by design? When we design a system, who is an insider and who gets left on the outside? In this presentation I discuss the relationship between systems and UX, and look at the role that the boundaries we define play in the success or failure of our systems.

### Heuristic analysis and wireframing: Study Room Control Panel Design (2017)

In 2017, I was asked to provide feedback on and redesign a proposed interface for 4.3 inch touchscreen room-control panels used in library study rooms, on a timeline that did not accommodate user testing. I provided a heuristics-based critique of the original proposal provided by Libraries IT, developed updated wireframes to address the identified issues, and collaborated with a designer on-staff to develop a design comp of the improved interface, which has since been put into service.
