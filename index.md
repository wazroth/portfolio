## Selected UX Projects

### User interviews and paper prototyping for the Aligning Discovery and the User Journey project (2019)

The project team sought to better understand faculty and students' information discovery needs in the context of completing research projects. We conducted user interviews with a faculty member and three students, then engaged the same participants in a paper prototyping exercise. I led multiple synthesis/analysis sessions based on wall-walk and affinity-mapping approaches. The recommendations fed into a subsequent design sprint by the team and so far has resulted in a number of changes across the Libraries website -- some still in the works.

### Study Room control panel (2017)

I was presented with a proposed interface for a 4.3 inch touchscreen room-control panel for library study rooms and asked to provide feedback. I provided a UX critique and updated wireframes, and collaborated with a designer on-staff to develop a design comp.

### How Do You Talk To a Building? Patron-facing tools for space and service discovery at the D.H. Hill Jr. Library (2016)

A strategic initiative with a goal of enhancing patron-facing information at the D. H. Hill Jr. Library, to ensure that patrons received in-building space and service information in a manner that was timely, relevant, and easy to comprehend. Dre was project lead.

## Selected Presentations

### The City and the City: Insider and outsider experiences in systems and UX

Presentation at UX Y'all 2020. How do we know whether a problem can be solved by design? In this presentation I discuss the relationship between systems and UX, and look at the role that the boundaries we define play in the success or failure of our systems.

### Systems thinking: a practical field guide (2018)

Presentation at the Code4Lib 2018 conference; reprised at UX Y'all 2019. An introduction to reading and analyzing systems in the wild, with an emphasis on unpacking a system's key features starting with scant information.

### It's made of people: designing systems for humans (2017)

Invited keynote presentation at the Code4Lib 2017 conference. Reprised as an invited keynote at the 2019 NC Serials Conference and an invted talk at the 2019 East Carolina University Joyner Library Staff Development Day. We rely on systems in our day-to-day work, but systems are at best flawed representations of our own work and our customers' goals. How do we ensure that our system is effective and friendly to the human actors in light of their inherent limitations?

### Architecture is politics: the power and the perils of systems design (2016)

Presentation at the Code4Lib 2016 conference. As the designers and implementers of complex systems (such as websites, discovery tools, and knowledge repositories), we have great -- if sometimes unrealized -- power. And, as Stan Lee says, with great power comes great responsibility.

## Selected Graphical and Video Projects

### Mid-South Fencers' Club Longsword Program logo (2017)

Dre is the lead instructor (and, as it turns out, lead designer) for Mid-South Fencers' Club's longsword program. His goal in this project was to create a design appropriate for multiple applications (program logo, t-shirt design, club banner) to represent the program, highlighting the club's Durham heritage and integrating the idea of the longsword into the logo.

### *One Perfect Source?* instructional video (2014)

A tutorial video for freshman college students, created for the NC State University Libraries instruction program. "Your topic seemed so great! So why can't you find any information on it? If you're looking for an all-in-one source that addresses your topic perfectly, you might need a different approach." Dre's role: Writing, editing, audio production, cat consultant

### *Peer Review in 3 Minutes* instructional video

A tutorial video for freshman college students, created for the NCSU Libraries instruction program. "How do articles get peer reviewed? What role does peer review play in scholarly research and publication?" Dre's role: Project co-lead, writing, editing

### *Teach yourself: a more sustainable e-learning framework for first-year instruction* video "virtual poster"

Virtual poster submission for ACRL 2015 conference. "In 2011, our three-librarian instruction team undertook a comprehensive
review and redesign of our online tutorial, with the goals of improving its curricular foundation, its technological underpinnings,
and its sustainability, culminating in the “Teach Yourself” suite of instructional modules." Dre's role: Project co-lead, design, development, editing

### *Anatomy of a Scholarly Article* interactive tutorial (2009)

An interactive tutorial highlighting the parts of a scholarly article, and the purpose and significance of each part. Although the definition of "peer reviewed article" is quite subtle, a college freshman will typically identify one taxonomically. This tutorial is meant to facilitate that sort of identification. Dre designed, developed, and implemented this tutorial from the ground up.
