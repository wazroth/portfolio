## Selected Project Work

### User interviews and paper prototyping for the Aligning Discovery and the User Journey project (2019)

The project team sought to better understand faculty and students' information discovery needs in the context of completing research projects. We conducted user interviews with a faculty member and three students, then engaged the same participants in a paper prototyping exercise. I led multiple synthesis/analysis sessions based on wall-walk and affinity-mapping approaches. The recommendations fed into a subsequent design sprint by the team and so far has resulted in a number of changes across the Libraries website -- some still in the works.

### Study Room control panel (2017)

In 2017, I was asked to provide feedback on and redesign a proposed interface for 4.3 inch touchscreen room-control panels used in library study rooms, on a timeline that did not accommodate user testing. I provided a heuristics-based critique of the original proposal provided by Libraries IT, developed updated wireframes to address the identified issues, and collaborated with a designer on-staff to develop a design comp of the improved interface, which has since been put into service.

### How Do You Talk to a Building? Patron-facing Tools for Space and Service Discovery at the D.H. Hill Jr. Library (2016)

A strategic initiative with a goal of enhancing patron-facing information at the D. H. Hill Jr. Library, to ensure that patrons received in-building space and service information in a manner that was timely, relevant, and easy to comprehend. I was project co-lead, with NC State Universty Libraries colleague Josephine McRobbie.
