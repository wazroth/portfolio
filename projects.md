## Selected UX Projects

### User interviews and paper prototyping for the Aligning Discovery and the User Journey project (2019)

The project team sought to better understand faculty and students' information discovery needs in the context of completing research projects. We conducted user interviews with a faculty member and three students, then engaged the same participants in a paper prototyping exercise. I led multiple synthesis/analysis sessions based on wall-walk and affinity-mapping approaches. The recommendations fed into a subsequent design sprint by the team and so far has resulted in a number of changes across the Libraries website -- some still in the works.

### Study Room control panel (2017)

I was presented with a proposed interface for a 4.3 inch touchscreen room-control panel for library study rooms and asked to provide feedback. I provided a UX critique and updated wireframes, and collaborated with a designer on-staff to develop a design comp.

### How do you talk to a building? Patron-facing tools for space and service discovery at the D.H. Hill Jr. Library (2016)

A strategic initiative with a goal of enhancing patron-facing information at the D. H. Hill Jr. Library, to ensure that patrons received in-building space and service information in a manner that was timely, relevant, and easy to comprehend. Dre was project lead.
